Small application to make inventory of the pharmacy cabinet I have at home

Upcoming (hopefully): 
- Functioning database to add some actual medications
- Better design of the pages because it's currently a pain to look at
- Functioning date format so the app can establish whether or not the medication is past its date
- Adding functions to order the stock page in certain ways
- Notifications telling the user something is about to expire / has expired

Projet fait pour apprendre le Kotlin et reprendre un peu la main avec la programmation Android
